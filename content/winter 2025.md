*The frosty wind bites at my face, sharp and unforgiving, as if determined to leave a mark. It stings, but only just; its unseen hands whipping my hair against my soul.*

The challenge of life is that nothing finds permanence; uncertainty lingers like a dense fog. Like the second law of thermodynamics, all energy tends towards disorder. Maybe this is merely an echo of an endless cycle, spiraling inward until thought dissolves into fatigue.

I think, and I think again - thoughts folding in on themselves, circling, unraveling. The passing of the days eludes me: the sun rises, the sun sets, and still, I sit, motionless, empty-handed.

Now, I'm walking roads I don't remember traveling, drifting through aisles without seeing, hearing voices without listening. The city hums, the lights shimmer, the air twists, like a dream I cannot wake up from. My thoughts sprint ahead, untethered, leaving my body trailing behind, shambling, lost, without direction.

*Where am I?*
Wintertime was a blur of lackluster meetings, uncertainties, and transitory existence. Joy slipped through my fingers with every waking moment, so I found serenity in the small moments. I watched a sunset in silence, lit a tea candle by a fresh vase of flowers, and savored the bright sweetness of an orange. I'm not sure if I'm swimming or sinking, but I keep breathing.

Sometimes, just sitting in my chair with my stuffed animals was enough, in a quiet space by the window, where the gusts dull to a soft breeze.

The faces around me seem distant, muted by the turmoil of recent politics. I smile cheekily at them each morning, hoping to lift their spirits. The wind gnaws at my face, my fingertips turning blue. Is it determination or apathy I feel against the prickly air?

I'm not sure of the answer. My energy no longer flows; fractured, it crashes endlessly against the tides, crosswinds thick with resistance, like dragging through mire. I'm guilty of projecting unstable energy, an unsteady, persistent rhythm I struggle to unlearn.

As the extraordinary fades, I search for meaning in the ordinary.

*Who am I?*
I'm often asked of who I am, and I seldom have an answer. I've worn a hundred selves and I've forgotten the lives I've lived. A fragmented isolation etched on my heart, tangled in the enigma of my past. My memory is there, but its edges are blurred, like an old photograph smudged over time. 

I write, I paint, and I stress over my homework weeks before the deadline. I argue with myself out loud, and I will spontaneously bake a chocolate cake because I intensely crave sugar some days. I cackle obnoxiously when sending emotes to my friends and family, and I treat my stuffed animals like they are my children.

Perhaps it's a misconception that we must find ourselves in what we do. That we must discover our purpose from hiking in nature, from toiling in our careers, as if identity were a treasure waiting to be found. I've mistaken observation for understanding. The truth is simpler, yet harder: it's not about finding ourselves, but creating ourselves.

And then one morning, the grass is green again, tulips in bloom, but the wind still lingers, like winter never left.
